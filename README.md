# Decision Tree Practice ğŸ§ ğŸŒ³  

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **Iris dataset** from `scikit-learn`.  
The model is trained and tested with different train-test split ratios, and the accuracy is analyzed.  

## ğŸ“Œ Features  
- Loads the **Iris dataset** ğŸ“Š  
- Splits the data into training and testing sets using various **test sizes**  
- Trains a **Decision Tree Classifier** ğŸŒ³  
- Evaluates model **accuracy** based on different train-test splits  
- Plots accuracy vs. test split ratio using **Matplotlib**  

## ğŸš€ Installation  

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib numpy




ğŸ“œ Usage
Run the script:

bash
Kopiuj
Edytuj



ğŸ“ˆ Results
The script will produce a graph like this:

X-axis: Test Split Ratio
Y-axis: Accuracy Score
This helps determine the optimal test split size for better model performance.

ğŸ›  Future Improvements
Experiment with different Decision Tree parameters (e.g., depth, criteria)
Use Cross-Validation for better evaluation
Try other classifiers like Random Forest or SVM
